Our additions:

Instructions button ("How do I play??") 
- shown in the main menu.
When pressed - pops a messagebox with 
instructions of the boggle game.

An exit button that, when pressed, first of all hides
all the widgets but the time (letters, score and other frames), 
shows a messagebox  that asks you if you're sure you 
want to exit.
When pressed "yes" - it exits the program
When pressed "no" - it prints all the widgets back 
to the screen and continues the game.

A restart button - takes you back to the main menu
(in case the player wants to read the instructions again, 
or simply start a new game).
The next time the player clicks "start" - 
the bord will be randomly chosen once again, the time 
and the score will set to their initial mode.

Plus, we added background image and all kinds of 
other features to make the game look nicer, such as:
1. when there are 10 seconds left on the clock - it will 
start switching from red to black
2. when the time passes - the player gets an informative 
message and will see in it his score
3. each found word is added to the "Found Words", 
and is shown at the top of the list, tha player has 
a scrollbar if he'd like to see previous words


* the program is easy to change and you can very 
easly decide how many seconds you want the 
game to last (default is 180 - 3 minutes)

Enjoy ^^
